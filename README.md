## Main Features

### Slash Commands
The package supports Discord Slash Commands. Slash Commands are a way to interact with your bot by typing a "/" followed by a command, providing a streamlined and intuitive user experience.

### Prefix Commands
In addition to Slash Commands, the package also supports traditional Prefix Commands. These are commands that are triggered by a specific prefix followed by the command name.

## Requirements
- NodeJS `v18.11.0` or higher
- Code Editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad)

## Installation
To use **SlashCommandPackage**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command below in the terminal.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/muhamdaily/discordjs.git
    ```

2. Open the terminal in the `SlashCommandPackage` folder and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Open the file `.env.example`, copy all its contents, and paste them into a new file called `.env`. Fill in all the required sections in the `.env` file.

4. Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file by running the command:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
5. Configure `src/config.json` to your liking. This file contains the configuration for the bot.
    ```json
    {
        "developer": [
            "MASUKKAN ID DEVELOPER DISINI", // use comma (,) to separate the ID
        ]
    }
    ```

6. Copy the following command to run the bot:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This command will run the `src/index.js` file using **nodemon**.
